I am a 3D rigger mainly learning Python for Autodesk Maya. I post tools and helper scripts that I've made for an efficient workflow! As I learn more about scripting and coding, I aim to  apply my knowledge to other programs like Houdini and Unreal Engine in the future. A few of these are a W.I.P. and were some ideas that I have for future scripts.
